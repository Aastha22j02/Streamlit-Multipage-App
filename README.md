# How to create a multi-page streamlit web app
From `streamlit version 1.10` onwards, you can now create native streamlit multipage web apps. In this tutorial, I will walk you through an example of how to develop such a streamlit multipage web app. In particular, I will show you how to add multiple pages, including favicons and how to use the streamlit session state to share variables/values between pages.<br/>
To follow along, ensure to use the latest streamlit version by running `pip install streamlit --upgrade`<br/><br/>
